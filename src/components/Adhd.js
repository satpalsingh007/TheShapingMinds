                    <p className="section-text">
                        ADHD often presents in childhood, but symptoms can persist into adulthood. ADHD is characterized by three main symptoms:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Inattention:</strong> Difficulty staying focused, making careless mistakes, and following instructions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> Excessive movement, difficulty sitting still, and fidgeting.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> Acting without thinking, making hasty decisions, or interrupting others. While the condition is not caused by poor parenting or lack of discipline, it can be influenced by genetics, brain structure, and environmental factors.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="section-title">How ADHD Affects Relationships and Social Interactions</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">
                        <strong>Relationship Challenges:</strong> ADHD can significantly impact social relationships. People with ADHD may struggle to maintain friendships or work relationships due to impulsivity, forgetfulness, or difficulty focusing during conversations. They might miss social cues, interrupt others, or fail to follow through on commitments, which can lead to frustration or misunderstanding in personal and professional settings.

                    <p className="section-text">Trouble with listening or paying attention during conversations.</p>

                    <p className="section-text">
                        ADHD is not just about difficulty focusing or staying still—it can also have a deep emotional and psychological impact on individuals. People with ADHD often struggle with self-esteem due to their constant feelings of inadequacy or failure, especially in academic or professional settings.
                    </p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Anxiety and Stress:</strong> The constant pressure to meet expectations can cause overwhelming stress.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Anxiety and Depression:</strong> People with ADHD may experience feelings of depression, especially if they feel misunderstood or judged.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Low Self-Esteem:</strong> Difficulty with organization or attention can lead to negative self-perception.</p>
