                    <p className="section-text">
                        Stress is the body’s natural response to danger, either real or imagined. When you feel threatened in some way, your body activates the stress response or “fight-or-flight” mode to keep you safe.

                    <h2 className="section-title">How Stress Happens</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">
                        Stress comes with physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include increased heartbeat, rapid breathing, and tension. Cognitive signs of stress can involve racing thoughts and difficulty concentrating.

                    <h2 className="section-title">How does it affect the body</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">
                        When you’re under stress, your body releases stress hormones, prompting changes such as rapid heartbeat and muscle tension. Over time, stress can harm your body and overall well-being.
