                    <h2 className="section-title">The Importance of Mental Wellness</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">
                        Mental wellness is just as important as physical health, as it affects every aspect of our lives. Good mental health enables individuals to cope with stress, work productively, and maintain positive relationships. Conversely, poor mental health can affect your ability to function and thrive. With the increasing pressures of modern life, mental wellness programs play a critical role in providing support and resources to help individuals manage challenges before they lead to more serious issues like burnout, depression, or anxiety.
