                    <p className="section-text">
                        Workplace stress can have a profound effect on an individual’s mental health. Prolonged exposure to high levels of stress can lead to anxiety, depression, burnout, and a range of physical issues such as headaches, digestive problems, and sleep disturbances. Common sources of stress include unrealistic workloads, lack of recognition, poor relationships with colleagues, and job insecurity. Addressing these stressors early can prevent serious mental health issues and improve overall workplace morale.

                    <p className="section-text">
                        While traditional therapy often focuses on personal life challenges, workplace counselling is specifically designed to address work-related stress and emotional issues in the professional environment. Workplace counselling is often short-term, goal-oriented, and can be tailored to address specific issues such as job performance, communication skills, or conflict resolution. It is typically more accessible and can be done on-site or through virtual sessions, offering employees a convenient way to access support without taking time off work.
