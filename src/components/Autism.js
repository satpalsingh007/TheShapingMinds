                        Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects how a person perceives and interacts with the world.
                        It is characterized by challenges with social skills, communication, and behavior, but it varies widely across individuals.
                        The spectrum is broad, meaning each person with autism has unique strengths and challenges.

                    <p className="mental-health-description">
                        Autism is often referred to as a "spectrum" because it encompasses a wide range of symptoms, behaviors, and degrees of severity.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Classic Autism:</strong> Also known as "Autistic Disorder," characterized by significant challenges in communication and behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Asperger Syndrome:</strong> Often involves less severe symptoms, with individuals typically having normal to above-average intelligence but struggling with social interactions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS):</strong> This diagnosis is given when a person exhibits some, but not all, characteristics of autism.</p>
                    <p><strong>Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD):</strong> A rare condition in which a child develops normally but loses motor, social, and language skills between ages 2 and 4.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="section-title">How Autism Affects a Person</h2>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Social and Communication Challenges:</strong> People with autism often have difficulty understanding social cues, making eye contact, or engaging in conversation. This can lead to feelings of isolation or frustration. They may also struggle with understanding the perspective of others (called "theory of mind").</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Behavioral and Sensory Differences:</strong> Many individuals with autism have specific behavioral patterns, such as repetitive movements or routines. They may also experience heightened or reduced sensitivity to sensory input, which can make everyday environments overwhelming or comforting in unexpected ways.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="section-title">Emotional and Psychological Effects of Autism</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">Living with autism can have a significant emotional impact. Feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression are common, especially when an individual faces challenges with communication, social interaction, or navigating daily life.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Difficulty connecting with others can lead to feelings of loneliness or exclusion.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Anxiety and Depression:</strong> Many individuals with autism experience high levels of anxiety, especially in new or unpredictable situations. It's not uncommon for people with autism to also face depression, especially if they feel misunderstood or unable to express their needs.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Low Self-Esteem:</strong> Children and adults with autism may struggle with self-esteem due to challenges in school, work, or relationships. They may internalize negative feedback, leading to self-doubt or frustration.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="section-title">Managing Stress in Individuals with Autism</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">The stress experienced by people with autism is often heightened due to difficulties with communication, sensory processing, and navigating social environments. Stress can lead to a range of emotional and physical responses:</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Meltdowns:</strong> A common response to overwhelming stress, where an individual may lose control emotionally or physically. This can be a result of sensory overload, frustration, or a change in routine.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Burnout:</strong> After prolonged exposure to stress or overstimulation, individuals with autism may experience emotional and physical exhaustion, making it harder to manage even simple tasks.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="section-title">Self-Care for Individuals with Autism</h2>
                    <p className="section-text">Autistic individuals may experience mental health challenges like anxiety or depression. Learning to manage these emotions is crucial for well-being.</p>

                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Autism Organizations and Support Networks:</strong> Many organizations offer valuable resources, advocacy, and community for individuals with autism and their families.</p>
                    <p className="section-text"><strong>Therapists and Specialists:</strong> Professional help from psychologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and developmental specialists can provide tailored support.</p>
