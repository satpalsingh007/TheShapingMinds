                    <p className="section-text">
                        Marital discord can lead to significant emotional distress. Partners may experience feelings of sadness, anxiety, and frustration. Prolonged conflict can contribute to mental health issues, including depression and chronic stress, affecting overall well-being. Emotional exhaustion is a common result, as constant conflict drains energy and enthusiasm for the relationship.

                    <p className="section-text">
                        It’s crucial to recognize the early signs of marital discord, such as increased arguments, withdrawal from each other, and lack of intimacy. Identifying negative interaction patterns can help couples address issues before they escalate.

                    <p className="section-text">
                        Failing to address marital discord can have serious repercussions. It can lead to long-term emotional distress for both partners, affect the mental health of children, and create a toxic family environment. Ultimately, unresolved conflicts can erode trust and intimacy, jeopardizing the future of the relationship.

                    <p className="section-text">
                        It’s essential for individuals to prioritize self-care during periods of marital discord.
